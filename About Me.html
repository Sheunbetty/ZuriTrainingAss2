  <p>
    I am an Electrical Engineer by profession though I have worked more in the Industrial Technology sector and that is where I have gained a lot of valuable experience.
 <br>   I have experience in Application Support, Network Systems Management as well as I.T. Support.
  <br>  I am presently trying to upskill to hone my talents and pro-actively develop my knowledge and technical know-how for all things I.T.
<br>I have done some courses in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) with the Digital Bridge Institute before the COVID struck and I am also a Huawei Certified Network Associate (HCNA). <br>I also took part in the Data Analysis course with EntryLevel and I'm currently learning frontend development with Zuri in partnership with Ingressive4Good.

 <br>   I'll keep updating this profile with time especially when I don't have a deadline to meet. 
 <br>   This website is currently in development by me.
    <br> I'll be back soon!
